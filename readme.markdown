## Challenges we ran into
My teammate  Christine and I are fully employed and finding time to study and take online courses to build the project was tough and really challenging. 

Other challenges we ran into from a data engineering standpoint, was the way to constructed the pipeline  to minimize latency at every single step. If it's  a Dataflow job, we designed it so that as many elements as possible are happening in parallel because if data comes in late, especially when it comes to cybersecurity, it's no longer valuable, especially, during an emergency .

At the end we had to deal with challenges associated with streaming applications, you're talking about the 3V's; 

volume challenge because the data never stops coming and quickly grows, then velocity and It is important to design systems that can handle that extra load. Variety of data is the third challenge. If you are using only structured data, data coming from a mobile app, that is easy enough to handle. But what if you have unstructured data like voice data or images? 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned streaming in the Cloud can help us here,  so took a Data Engineering, Big Data, and Machine Learning on Google Cloud Plartform Specialization on Coursera, passed all requirements and  earned course certificates. 
## What we learned
During the course work, on the volume side we found a tool to assist in autoscaling processing and analysis, so that the system can handle the volume. On the velocity side,  a tool that can handle the variability of the streaming process was available. On the variety side, we looked at how artificial intelligence could help us with unstructured data. ## What's next for kafunge
Ngao+ to be adapted not only in Kenya but also by Africa's largest organisations as their one-stop threat intelligence platform that leverages Google Cloud's advanced features to proactively detect and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time.

Build a sustainability and profitability  business requiring a combination of smart pricing, diversification of revenue streams, excellent customer service, and a commitment to ongoing improvement and innovation. We intent to stay agile and adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape to remain competitive and meet customer needs.  

# GCP hands-on 

* This assumes you have a GCP account with some credits, 

We built the pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and used Google products such as Cloud Pub/Sub, a scalable data analytics product that facilitates data ingestion. Security events are published to Cloud Pub/Sub and then pull subscriptions make the data available to log parsers and other services via Googleâ€™s Cloud Dataflow, a fully managed service for stream and batch processing that puts the data in formats security analysts can use, then implemented an alerting system that triggers notifications when potential fraud is detected.

# 1. Data Collection and Integration:

We have data coming from external vendors, and all this data is ingested through Pub/Sub, and Pub/Sub pushes it through to Dataflow, which can parse or enrich the data .The way the data comes in can be simple such as comma-separated. Other times itâ€™s a mess. There is not a common format among the vendors

# 2. Data Ingestion

Used Google Cloud Pub/Sub to ingest the transaction data in real-time. This ensured that the data is continuously updated and available for analysis.

#  3. Data Preprocessing
We clean and preprocess the data to remove inconsistencies and format it for analysis. Google Cloud Dataflow is used for data preprocessing to ensure data quality.

#  4. Machine Learning Model Development

 We build a machine learning model using Google AI Platform. We trained these models on historical transaction data to recognize patterns associated with fraudulent activities.

#  5. Real-time Analysis Utilize 
Google Cloud's real-time data analysis tool, Cloud Dataflow and Cloud Pub/Sub, analyzes incoming transaction data in real-time. We Implemented custom rules and machine learning model to identify potential fraud based on transaction patterns.

#  6. Alerting and Reporting 
We implemented an alerting system that triggers notifications when potential fraud is detected. Google Cloud Monitoring is used to set up alerting and Google Data Studio for creating real-time dashboards and reports.

#  7. Feedback Loop
We created a feedback loop to continuously improve the machine learning models, so we re-train models with new data and refine detection algorithms to adapt to evolving fraud tactics.

#  8. Incident Response
We developed a well-defined incident response plan to address confirmed fraud cases. Ensuring that actions are taken promptly to prevent further damage.

#  9. Compliance
We ensured compliance with relevant data protection and privacy regulations in all phases of data processing and analysis.

#  10. Testing and Validation
 Before we deploying the system in a live environment, we thoroughly test and validate its accuracy and efficiency in detecting fraudulent activities.
